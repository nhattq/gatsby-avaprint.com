                  We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”)
                  to choose the demographic information of users who will see
                  their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree

                  in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate
                  audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example,
                  we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show
                  you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will
                  not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow
                  Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage
                  patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information
                  to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner
                  that would identify you personally. Note that if an Advertiser
                  asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience
                  segment and you respond to that ad, the Advertiser may
                  conclude that you fit the description of the audience they

                  We may deliver a file to you through our services (known as a

                  networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research
                  and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also
                  enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you

                  request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad
