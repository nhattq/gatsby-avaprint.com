                      theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the
                      termination of the Agreements) will be determined by
                      mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You
                      and Dreamship further agree that the arbitrator will have
                      the exclusive power to rule on any disputes relating to
                      the interpretation, applicability, enforceability,

                      delay, laches, or estoppel. Arbitration is more informal
                      than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN
                      ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS
                      LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in
                      court. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration
                      Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a
                      court (including attorney fees), except that the
                      arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory
                      or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to
                      the arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement will survive
